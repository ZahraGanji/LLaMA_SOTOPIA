# Simulating Social Interactions With Movie-Driven Scenarios

## Motivation

This project aims to address the limitations in character realism, relationships, and scenarios in simulations. By leveraging movie-driven scenarios, we can enhance the authenticity and depth of character interactions.

## How It Works

### 1. Designing a Pipeline to Generate Scenarios Automatically
- **Incorporate Realistic Backgrounds**: Integrate movie scenes with rich, detailed backgrounds to create more immersive and realistic scenarios.

### 2. Evaluate the Social Intelligence of LLMs Using Movie Characters
- **Leverage Detailed Dynamics**: Use the intricate dynamics and relationships depicted in movies to inform and enrich character attributes and interactions.
- **Evaluate Social Intelligence**: Apply the SOTOPIA-EVAL framework to assess the social intelligence and interaction quality of language models.

## The Pipeline

1. **Establish Types of Human Interactions**:
   - Define and categorize various human interactions based on movie scenes and character behaviors.

2. **Movie Scene Extraction**:
   - Extract and analyze scenes from movies to build a repository of interaction scenarios and background details.

3. **Validation of Scenario Existence by LLMs**:
   - Use language models to verify and validate the existence and relevance of generated scenarios.

4. **Assign Complexity Levels**:
   - Assess and assign complexity levels to the scenarios based on their depth and realism.

5. **Evaluation by SOTOPIA-Eval**:
   - Employ the SOTOPIA-EVAL framework to evaluate the effectiveness and authenticity of the generated scenarios in terms of social interactions and character intelligence.
